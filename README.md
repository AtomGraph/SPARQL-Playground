# SPARQL-Playground
A client-side SPARQL playground

**Available online on [https://atomgraph.github.io/SPARQL-Playground/](https://atomgraph.github.io/SPARQL-Playground/)**

Unlike other server-based SPARQL playgrounds, this runs completely in the browser. It only accepts RDF data from user input and does not query remote datasources.
Multiple RDF input/output formats as well SPARQL result formats are supported.

Inspired by [martin-honnen](https://github.com/martin-honnen)'s [Saxon-JS 2.5 XSLT 3 Fiddle](https://martin-honnen.github.io/xslt3fiddle/).
